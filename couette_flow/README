Hi Dr. Ranjan 

The compiler I used is: 			GCC version 5.4.0
The Makefile program I used is:		GNU Make 4.2.1



I intended for this program to be easy to run, here are some guidelines:

- The source code for the second project is found in the "program" folder.

- There are 2 main programs which have a common input file and Makefile.

- To build the code that writes the initial condition file, type: "make wi"

- To build the Couette flow solver, type "make cf"

- To write the innitial condition file, open "inputfile.dat" and set the filename
  on line 1 (it writes this file), then set jmax and type "./write_initial.exe".

- To run the Couette solver, set the initial-state file name, most likely the same 
  as before, then set the final-state file name to what the solver should write. Set
  all other parameters at this time as well, then type "./couette_main.exe".



That sums it up, the error I would make while doing different jmax cases would be to 
not "re-write" the initial condition file, so keep this in mind. But I'm also pretty 
brain dead, so that might have something to do with it.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Thanks,
