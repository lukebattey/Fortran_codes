init_couette.dat	! Input File Name (initial conditions)
fin_couette.dat		! Output File Name (output/restart state)
0.5		            ! dt*  (non-dim'd time step)
51		 			! jmax  (num points over L)
5e-7				! Steady-State RMS error convergence criteria
1.0					! theta  (0 for expl. solver. > 0 for Combined Method A)
1000000  		    ! nmax  (max # of iterations) 
10	 				! error write frequency (1 is default)

The stability criterion: r = (dt*)((jmax-1)^2)  should be < 0.5 for Theta = 0

Remember that if different j spacing is desired, write_initial.exe MUST be ran again
because the input condition is changing..
