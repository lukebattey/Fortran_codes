Hi Dr. Ranjan 

The compiler I used is: 			GCC version 5.4.0
The Makefile program I used is:		GNU Make 4.2.1


I intended for this program to be easy to run, here are some guidelines:

- The source code for the second project is found in the "program" folder.
  This is where I would build and run the code, then the outputs would be
  copied to the "postproc" folder, which has its own README.

- To build the Supersonic Solver, type "make ss"

- Typing "make clean" will remove the ".o" and ".mod" files

- To run the supersonic solver, open "inputfile.dat" and set the initial-state 
  file name, most likely the same as before, then set the final-state file 
  name to what the solver should write. Set all other parameters at this time 
  as well, then type "./s_sonic_main.exe" in the command line.
  

That sums it up, the error I would make while doing different cases would be to 
not rename the write file name to the actual case I was running..  

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Thanks,
