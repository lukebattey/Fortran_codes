This folder contains all the files used to take the supplied grid
and convert it to a format that I am more familiar with.

The new format is "Tecplot ASCII" and written with zones that clearly
reflect the actual I and J directions with no outside information needed.

If desired, open "inputfile.dat" and set the names of the grid files, then
run "grid_convert.exe" to complete the conversion.
