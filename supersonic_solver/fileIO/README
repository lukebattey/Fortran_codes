1. This folder contains an example program to write out ASCII data in a format
which can be read in Tecplot. The format allows to write out time varying 
dataset.

The folder structure is as follows:
├── bin
├── data
│   └── fileIO.dat
├── Makefile
├── README
└── src
    ├── fileIO.F90
    └── tecio.F90

- The bin folder contains the executable program.

- The data folder contains output of the program.

- Makefile can be used to compile the program. Specify the compiler through 
  modifying the values of FC, CC, CXX. The default compiler is set to Intel.

- The src folder contains the source code, which comprises of two fortran 
  files.

2. To compile the program, do the following in this folder on a terminal after
specifying the compiler type in the Makefile:

$ make

This will build the executable, which is saved in ./bin folder

3. To run the program, do the following on the terminal

$ ./bin/fileIO.x

The program will print some messages on the terminal and will save the
Tecplot file in the data folder

4. To visualize the data do the following:

$ tec360 data/fileIO.dat
